Once you servers have deployed, you can ssh onto them using the ${BUILD_HOME}/helperscripts/ scripts. Once you are into a machine, you can root yourself by going to ${HOME}/.ssh and then doing a ls SERVERUSER_PASSWORD* this will return something like, SERVERUSER_PASSWORD:dvjijdvj388jhs. THe part after the colon is the password. Do a sudo su and enter it as the password in order to attain root.
