I just wanted to set out what I am trying to build by coding up this framework. I think there are several objectives

1) To build a framework which can deploy web applications to any one of n providers without the deployer having to know much or
even any technical details of how the deployment process works.

2) Considering 1 to be true, to also provide the facility for power users to do literally anything they want with the servers 
their web application is deployed on

3) To make the framework extensible and customisable to that it can be easily customised to support other technologies and, also,
if the manner in which an already supported technology is configured isn't as required, it is easy to configure it differently.
