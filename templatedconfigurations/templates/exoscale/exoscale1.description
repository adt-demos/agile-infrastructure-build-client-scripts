----------------------------------------------------------------------

DETAIL: This template will spin up the nuocialboss application on exoscale in geneva. It deploys to "tiny" machines and in development mode rather than production. By default you need to select debian 10 as the build OS. The database used is a Maria DB instance running on a VPS machine in the exoscale cloud. The DNS provider is cloudflare. You will need an exoscale account and a cloudflare account to be able to deploy this application.
Starting from scratch, you would need to 1. Setup a cloudflare account. 2. Setup an exoscale account. 3. Register your DNS name with cloudflare and obtain the cloudflare "Global API Key" and you need to create IAM keys on exoscale with the capabilites to access the object store and to create server machines. 4. Update the template file with ${BUILD_HOME}/templatedconfigurations/templates/exoscale/exoscale1.tmpl with the values obtained in 3 5. run the build script (selecting debian as the deployment OS).
