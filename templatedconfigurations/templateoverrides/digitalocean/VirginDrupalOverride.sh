#To use this file, review every variable and set it appropriately, then copy it to your userdata area when you create your build droplet
#you can refer to the specification for the ADT templating system to review this parameters which is located at: https://github.com/agile-deployer/agile-infrastructure-build-client-scripts/blob/master/templatedconfigurations/specification.md
#To make your build possible fill in all these environment variables and paste this entire (updated) file into the userdata are of your build client droplet. 
#All of these variables need to be set correctly for the build to work. You will need to obtain these values from digital ocean and cloudflare:
#S3_ACCESS_KEY - "Your digital ocean spaces access key"
#S3_SECRET_KEY - "Your digital ocean spaces secret key"
#TOKEN - "Your digital ocean personal access token"
#DNS_USERNAME - "Your cloudflare email address"
#DNS_SECURITY_KEY - "Your cloudflare global API key"
#The rest you can generate or set locally yourself, but, all these variables must be set correctly before you add this script to the user data of your droplet

#The values above are the values that I override by default. If, for example, you wanted to override the size of your webserver machines you could 
#simply add an export statement beneath the additional overrides section below 
# and define it for your provider based on the template specification. Similarly for any of the other variables that you find in 
#the template. You need to be aware of how the variables play with each other, which needs to be set with which, for example. Running the 
#full AgileDeploymentToolkit script and setting the configuration you desire will give you an env dump upon successful completion in the 
#${BUILD_HOME}/buildcompletion directory which will show you which variables need to be set for the particular configuration you desire.
